# HealthOS
HealthOS is a personal health consultant web app. Users upload medical reports (PDFs or images), the app extracts and flags lab/vital values, tracks a running health score, and offers an AI chat assistant that can answer questions using the user's own health history.

## My Contribution
This was a 3-person hackathon project (AMD Developer Hackathon). I owned the backend authentication and data layer:
- **Auth system** (`app/auth.py`, `app/routers/auth.py`) — password hashing with bcrypt, JWT-based session tokens, `get_current_user` dependency for protected routes
- **Database layer** (`app/database.py`, `app/models.py`) — SQLAlchemy 2.0 ORM models and engine/session setup, PostgreSQL with native UUID columns
- **Config & environment setup** (`app/config.py`) — Pydantic settings loaded from `.env`
- Coordinated Docker-based deployment with the team under the hackathon deadline

## Features
- **Auth** — signup/login with hashed passwords and JWT-based sessions.
- **Report upload & analysis** — PDF and image reports are parsed (with OCR fallback for scanned documents), key values (cholesterol, glucose, blood pressure, etc.) are extracted and flagged as normal / high / low / urgent.
- **Dashboard** — an overall health score plus a short list of plain-language insights generated from the user's latest data.
- **Chat assistant** — a health-context-aware chatbot that can discuss a specific report or general health questions, using the user's profile, recent lab values, and name.
- **Profile** — stores age, sex, height, weight, conditions, and medications.

AI features (report analysis, dashboard insights, chat replies) call the Fireworks AI API when `FIREWORKS_API_KEY` is set. Without a key, the app falls back to deterministic, rule-based logic so it still works end to end.

## Tech stack
**Backend**
- FastAPI + SQLAlchemy
- PostgreSQL (uses native `UUID` columns, so Postgres is required — SQLite is not supported as-is)
- JWT auth
- Fireworks AI (LLM calls), pypdf / pdf2image / pytesseract (report text extraction & OCR)

**Frontend**
- React 19 + Vite
- React Router
- Tailwind CSS
- lucide-react icons

## Local setup
### Backend
```bash
cd healthos
uv sync                       # or: pip install -e . / pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Create `healthos/.env`:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/healthos
SECRET_KEY=some-long-random-string
ALGORITHM=HS256
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=60
FIREWORKS_API_KEY=your-api-key
FIREWORKS_MODEL=accounts/fireworks/models/llama-v3p1-8b-instruct
```
Run the API:
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
The API is served at `http://localhost:8000`, with routes under `/api`.

### Frontend
```bash
cd healthos-frontend
npm install
```
Create `healthos-frontend/.env`:
```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
```
Run the dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The app is served at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Environment variables reference
| File | Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `healthos/.env` | `DATABASE_URL` | Postgres connection string |
| `healthos/.env` | `SECRET_KEY` | JWT signing secret |
| `healthos/.env` | `ALGORITHM` | JWT algorithm (`HS256`) |
| `healthos/.env` | `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES` | JWT expiry |
| `healthos/.env` | `FIREWORKS_API_KEY` | Optional — enables AI-generated analysis/chat |
| `healthos/.env` | `FIREWORKS_MODEL` | Fireworks model id |
| `healthos-frontend/.env` | `VITE_API_URL` | Base URL the frontend calls for the API |

## Notes
- Uploaded report files are saved to `uploads/` on the backend's local disk. If you redeploy or move the backend without carrying this folder, "view original file" will 404 for older reports (the extracted summary/values still work, since those are in the database).
- CORS origins are currently hardcoded in `app/main.py` to local dev URLs — update this before deploying (see Deployment below).
